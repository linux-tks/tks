# tks-cli

Command line utility for TKS, allowing to manage your TKS vaults and secrets.

While this tool is under development, you may want to use GNOME's
[secret-tool](https://developer.gnome.org/secret-tool/stable/) instead.
Current tks-service implementation is already compatible with secret-tool.
