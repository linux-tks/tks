TKS Keeps Secrets, otherwise called "Tux Keeps Secrets", pronounced the same
as "ticks".

## Aim

This project aims to provide a secure way to store secrets on a Linux system.
It is designed to be used by a single user, and is not intended to be used by
multiple users. Main design goals are:
- Secure
- Easy to use from the command line
- Easy to use from scripts
- Easy to use from other programs
- No dependencies on any Desktop Environment
- No dependencies on any other programs
- As close to zero configuration as possible

This project is inspired by the problems I've encountered when I was
maintaining KDE's KWallet system. I've also been inspired by other password
managers.
